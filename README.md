# user.js
These files generate my Firefox config.

1. Run `create.bat`
2. Copy the generated `user.js` into your Firefox profile directory, preferably before the profile's initial launch.
3. Launch the Firefox profile
4. After launching, `prefs.js` will contain all the prefs set in `user.js`. To override `user.js` prefs from within the browser, you should first delete `user.js`

⚠️ Warning: This config clears cookies when the browser closes
- You should specify sites whose cookies should persist beyond shutdown
